# simpleJokeApp
Repository for the simple joke web application used by my project work for "Cloud Computing II" at the Baden-Wuerttemberg Cooperative State University (DHBW) Stuttgart.

# Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to be used for the virtual machines provisioned by Terraform. This repository is downloaded, extracted and used by these VMs over Ansible to provide a public instance of the simple joke web app.

# References
This application uses the following API for fetching random jokes: https://official-joke-api.appspot.com 

The webpage uses jquery from the [Google Hosted Libraries](https://developers.google.com/speed/libraries).
